Tetris Game
Description:
This project is a Tetris game built using C++ OOP and Raylib, featuring smooth gameplay and particle effects when a row of blocks is cleared. 
Each block breaks into smaller particles when a row is full, adding a dynamic visual effect.

Features:
Classic Tetris mechanics.
Particle effects that simulate block destruction when rows are cleared.
Smooth gameplay with frame-independent movement using delta time.
Customizable particle system with gravity and random motion.

Technologies
C++: The core programming language used to implement game logic.
Raylib: A simple and easy-to-use library for handling graphics, input, and more.

How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed:
